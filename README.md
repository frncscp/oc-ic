## Getting started
To be able to use the training and analysis code, you will need to met the following requirements:
- Use .h5 Tensorflow or HuggingFace models.
- Have a training dataset consisting of a positive and a pseudo-negative class, divided just on classes, not on subsets.

Then you can execute training_and_analysis.py! You'll have to answer some questions to gather the data needed for the computation.
