# One-Class Image Classification with AI Algorithms

This research aims to find the most optimal way to perform image classification where just one type of class is important,

- Convolutional Neural Networks
   - Autoencoders
   - Generative Adversarial Networks
   - Fully Conected Networks (Mid perfomance, fast)
- Anomaly Detection Algorithms
   - One Class Support Vector Machines
   - Isolation Forests
   - Decision Trees
- Visual Transformers (Great perfromance, medium-to-fast)
- Zero-Shot Classification (Great performance, slow)

## Getting started
To be able to use the training and analysis code, you will need to met the following requirements:
- Use .h5 Tensorflow or HuggingFace models.
- Have a training dataset consisting of a positive and a pseudo-negative class, divided just on classes, not on subsets.

Then you can execute training_and_analysis.py! You'll have to answer some questions to gather the data needed for the computation.
